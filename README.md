Official implementation for "Theoretical Insights into Ensemble Strategies for Image Post-Hoc Explanation"

*Image post-hoc explanation methods often exhibit high variance or disagreement across explanations when the input data are perturbed, the underlying models are modified, or different explainability techniques are employed. To mitigate this issue, several novel approaches have been proposed, among which ensemble strategies have attracted particular attention. Although some of these methods demonstrate good empirical performance, most existing works remain largely empirical, with limited theoretical justification or understanding. In this study, we investigate different datasets, convolutional neural network architectures, imputation techniques, and ensembling strategies to identify the most influential image patches. In particular, we compare various ensembling strategies based on distinct voting principles - namely, Borda Count, Kemeny–Young, Reciprocal Rank Fusion, and the Schulze method - and show that these approaches perform well as their underlying theoretical assumptions begin to hold.*
